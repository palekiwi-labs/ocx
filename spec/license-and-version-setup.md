# Proper open source project setup

---

The purpose of this project is to serve as an open-source freely accessible tool
that can aid in promotion and adoption of `opencode`.

TODO:
- specify the technical and formal requirements of a robust FOSS project
- analyze the repo for missing elements (license, versioning, version tags, etc.)
- add the missing elements

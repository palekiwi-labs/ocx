# Improve opencode dockerfile build

---

## Context

`ocx` needs to run on both amd and arm architectures.
Currently we use a switch statement on `uname -m`.

Compare to the official Dockerfile image that uses `TARGETARCH` and suggest improvements:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine AS base

# Disable the runtime transpiler cache by default inside Docker containers.
# On ephemeral containers, the cache is not useful
ARG BUN_RUNTIME_TRANSPILER_CACHE_PATH=0
ENV BUN_RUNTIME_TRANSPILER_CACHE_PATH=${BUN_RUNTIME_TRANSPILER_CACHE_PATH}
RUN apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep

FROM base AS build-amd64
COPY dist/opencode-linux-x64-baseline-musl/bin/opencode /usr/local/bin/opencode

FROM base AS build-arm64
COPY dist/opencode-linux-arm64-musl/bin/opencode /usr/local/bin/opencode

ARG TARGETARCH
FROM build-${TARGETARCH}
RUN opencode --version
ENTRYPOINT ["opencode"]
```
